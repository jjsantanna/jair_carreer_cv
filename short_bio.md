[265 words] José Jair Cardoso de Santanna, ‘Jair’ for short, is a Cloud security lead at Northwave security and an assistant professor in the faculty of electrical engineering, mathematics and computer science (EEMCS) at University of Twente (NL). In 2010, he graduated in computer engineer from Federal University of Pará (BR) and he was awarded as one of the best computer engineer students of the year. In 2012, he received a M.Sc. degree in computer science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (BR) and the solution developed during his M.Sc. is still in use by the Brazilian National Research and Educational Network (RNP). In 2017, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Twente (NL). A number of solutions proposed in his Ph.D. thesis were deployed by network operators. He has acted as a technical advisor to law enforcement bodies worldwide (e.g., the Dutch High Tech Crime Unit, the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the UK National Crime Agency, and many others) on the topic of cyber security and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks, ransomware and multi-disciplinary data-driven research for cyber security are his main fields of interest. Besides his research career, Jair has a passion for public speaking that has been clearly noted. In less than six months as assistant professor (2018), he was voted by students as one of the best lectures of the EEMCS faculty. He also won the regional and national renowned competition for the best science communicator (FameLab). On funding raising, he has been the primary investigator in several Dutch, European and International projects.
