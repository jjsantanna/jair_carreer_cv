- **2018** [Winner of the FameLab NL ("the best scientific communicator of the country")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9av9ifNbMf8) -- FameLab is the biggest event for scientific communicators worldwide.

Each Famelab competitor has three minutes to present a scientific topic for a lay audience. The competitor with best content, clarity and charisma wins. In only three minutes, I explained in an engaging and enthusiastic way what is and how to solve Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. I used the analogy of a crowded King’s day and people wearing orange clothes.
