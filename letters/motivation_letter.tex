To the dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS)\\
Prof. dr. J.N. Kok 
}

\opening{Dear Prof. dr. Joost,}

On the 1st of October 2019, I resigned from my position as Assistant Professor at the University of Twente. On the 1st of December, I started a new job at Northwave BV as Cloud Security Leader. In the period in between these both events, I discussed with prof. Aiko Pras the possibility to stay at the University as a guest. His positive answers bring me to this letter.

This is my formal letter stating that I want and that I have the allowance from Northwave BV to stay one day a week as guest at our University of Twente. My motivation is to keep inspiring young researchers to built a more digitally secure society. 


\closing{Yours faithfully,}

\end{letter}
